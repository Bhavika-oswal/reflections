It helps us to view the bug easily.
we dont need to sit and compare each line.we can easily compare are versions of files.
pros are that we can commit whenever we want and cons are like most of the time we dont understand when to commit.
it is good that we can save multiple file in one commit.
git log is used to see the commits and their id's made so far.
git diff is used to see the no of insertions and deletions made.
